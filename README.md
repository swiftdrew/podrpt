## ‚ú® Key Features

* üöÄ **Fast Analysis**: Uses the native CocoaPods API for superior performance, avoiding slow shell-out commands.
* üìä **Slack Reports**: Sends cleanly formatted notifications directly to a Slack channel, ideal for CI/CD pipelines.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Assessment**: Assign custom risk scores and owner teams to each dependency via a `PodsRisk.yaml` file.
* üéØ **Dependency Filtering**: Ignore transitive dependencies and focus only on the pods you directly manage with a `PodsAllowlist.yaml`.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Interactive Setup**: A simple `init` command generates all the necessary configuration files to get you started.
* ü§ñ **CI/CD Focused**: Designed to run in automated environments without leaving behind unnecessary file artifacts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the three steps below to set up and run Podrpt in your project.

### 1. Installation

Add the gem to your project's `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'podrpt', '~> 1.0.0'
```

And then execute:
```sh
bundle install
```

## Setup
After installing the gem, you need to generate the configuration files in your project's root directory. Navigate to your iOS project's root folder and run the interactive setup command:

And then execute:
```sh
bundle exec podrpt init
```

This command will:

1 Create a sample **PodsRisk.yaml** file for defining risk scores.
```yaml
default:
  risk: 500
  owners: []
pods:
  XPTO:
    risk: 100
    owners: ['core-team']
```

2 Create a sample **PodsAllowlist.yaml** file for filtering dependencies.

3 Prompt you for your Slack Incoming Webhook URL and save it securely in a .podrpt.yml file (which should be added to your .gitignore).

After running init, customize the generated .yaml files to fit your project's needs.

## Usage
To run an analysis and send a report to Slack, simply execute the run command:

And then execute:
```sh
bundle exec podrpt run
```

If you want to see what will be sent and what URL is configured, use this command:

```sh
bundle exec podrpt run --dry-run
```

The report will only include outdated pods by default.
